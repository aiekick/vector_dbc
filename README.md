# Build on Linux (e.g. Debian Testing)

Building under Linux works as usual:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install DESTDIR=..
    make package

# Build on Windows (e.g. Windows 7 64-Bit)

Building under Windows contains the following steps:

* Use cmake-gui
* Set "Where is the source code:" to the root directory.
* Set "Where to build the binaries:" to folder build below the root directory. Eventually create it.
* Set option OPTION_USE_CPP11_REGEX
* Configure and Generate
* Open the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file in the build folder.
* Compile it.

Dynamic tests are

* Unit tests

The test execution can be triggered using

# Repository Structure

The following files are part of the source code distribution:

* src/_project_/
* src/_project_/tests/

The following files are working directories for building and testing:
